# Text-Line-Separator
image processing for OCR

A fun project from Algorithm class

Developed a java-based image processing tool to separate text lines in bitmap images, modeling pixels as a weighted 
graph using an adjacency list implementation. 
I used Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to identify  the white paths and different Black paths as well, I  optimized efficiency with a single graph instance and 
constant algorithm invocations.
 I utilized BitmapProcessor to load and analyze ARGB pixel data, this was able to ensure robust text separation for OCR applications which made it eaiser to visualize 
 the photoes from using ony Black and white.
